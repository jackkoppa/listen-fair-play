# Background

We have been using this NPM package for splitting apart files: https://www.npmjs.com/package/fluent-ffmpeg

In this file: /packages/ingestion/process-audio-lambda/process-new-audio-files-via-whisper.ts

However, we never successfully tested that NPM package approach in Lambda - only locally.
Once we tested on Lambda, it was failing with this error:

```

    at async Runtime.handler (file:///var/task/process-new-audio-files-via-whisper.js:94416:3)
```

Which is because the NPM package relies on binaries getting built during install, for the system it's on.

Once I started to look into this, I realized that the NPM package itself has been deprecated & the repository archived:
https://github.com/fluent-ffmpeg/node-fluent-ffmpeg/issues/1324

(this was pretty recent)

So let's not build off of that. Instead, let's use the native `ffmpeg` library, and let's make sure it's installed on the user's machine when running locally, and on Lambda via Lambda Layers.

Here's the steps I'd like you to take:

1. Move this whole section of `process-new-audio-files-via-whisper.ts`, that relates to ffmpeg, to a utils file in that package. Can make it something like `ffmpeg-utils.ts`, or some other name

2. Add specs that cover the functionality that we'll be adding to that utility function

3. Replace our usage of `fluent-ffmpeg`, and instead call the CLI `ffmpeg` directly. This might get a bit complex, so reference the docs as necessary: https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html

4. Make sure to, in that util, throw an error early (that gives instructions for local installation, and/or Lambda Layers) if the `ffmpeg` functionality is not available as expected

5. Once `fluent-ffmpeg` has been fully replaced, stop and let me know - so that I can re-test `pnpm process-audio-lambda:run:local` locally to make sure it's still working the same. Update what you've done so far in this doc.

---

6. After that checkpoint, proceed to make sure the Lambda Layer for `ffmpeg` is correctly configured in Terraform. I've gotten us started by already downloading the .tar & documenting a bit here:
terraform/lambda-layers/README.md
But you'll need to update Terraform for the Layer

7. Prompt me to test actually running this on Lambda then - if things are working, then this effort is complete!

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Steps 1-5 - FFmpeg Migration

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Created `ffmpeg-utils.ts`** - New utility module with native CLI ffmpeg calls:
   - `checkFfmpegAvailability()` - Validates ffmpeg/ffprobe installation with helpful error messages
   - `getAudioMetadata()` - Uses `ffprobe` CLI to get audio duration/metadata  
   - `createAudioChunk()` - Uses `ffmpeg` CLI to split audio files into chunks
   - `splitAudioFile()` - Main function for splitting large audio files
   - `prepareAudioFile()` - Prepares small files for processing

2. **Created comprehensive test suite** - `ffmpeg-utils.spec.ts` with:
   - Mocked child_process spawn calls
   - Tests for success/failure scenarios 
   - Error handling and cleanup verification
   - **‚úÖ 10 tests passing** covering all core functionality

3. **Updated main file** - `process-new-audio-files-via-whisper.ts`:
   - Removed all `fluent-ffmpeg` imports and usage
   - Updated to use new ffmpeg-utils functions
   - Maintained same functionality with CLI-based approach

4. **Removed deprecated dependencies**:
   - Removed `fluent-ffmpeg` and `@types/fluent-ffmpeg` from package.json
   - Added `vitest` for testing framework

5. **Added error handling** - Clear installation instructions for:
   - Local development (macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`, Ubuntu, Windows)
   - Lambda deployment (Lambda Layer configuration)

### ‚úÖ CHECKPOINT REACHED: All Tests Passing
The fluent-ffmpeg dependency has been completely replaced with native CLI calls. 

** ‚úÖ  Ready for Local Testing**
Please test `pnpm process-audio-lambda:run:local` to verify functionality before proceeding to Lambda Layer configuration.

User: confirmed this is working üéâ

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Step 6 - Lambda Layer Configuration

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Created FFmpeg Lambda Layer in Terraform** - `terraform/main.tf`:
   - Added `aws_lambda_layer_version` resource for ffmpeg
   - Configured for ARM64 architecture and Node.js 20.x runtime
   - Layer extracts binaries to `/opt/bin/` in Lambda environment

2. **Updated Whisper Lambda Configuration**:
   - Added `layers = [aws_lambda_layer_version.ffmpeg_layer.arn]` to whisper_lambda module
   - Lambda now has access to ffmpeg/ffprobe binaries

3. **Enhanced ffmpeg-utils.ts** with environment detection:
   - `getBinaryPaths()` function detects Lambda vs local environment
   - Uses `/opt/bin/ffmpeg` and `/opt/bin/ffprobe` in Lambda
   - Falls back to system PATH for local development
   - Automatic environment detection via `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME`

4. **Created automated layer preparation script** - `terraform/lambda-layers/1-prepare-ffmpeg-layer.sh`:
   - Downloads and extracts ffmpeg static binaries
   - Creates proper Lambda layer directory structure
   - Generates optimized `ffmpeg-layer.zip` (49MB)
   - Includes error handling and progress feedback

5. **Updated documentation** - `terraform/lambda-layers/README.md`:
   - Complete setup instructions for ffmpeg layer
   - Download, preparation, and deployment steps
   - Notes on file sizes and directory structure
   - Usage guidelines for Lambda functions

### ‚úÖ Infrastructure Ready for Deployment
- ‚úÖ Terraform configuration validated (`terraform validate` passed)
- ‚úÖ Lambda function built with updated ffmpeg utilities
- ‚úÖ FFmpeg layer zip created (49MB, optimized)
- ‚úÖ All tests passing locally

## üöÄ STEP 7: Ready for Lambda Testing

**Next Action Required:**
Please run `terraform apply` to deploy the ffmpeg Lambda layer and updated whisper function to AWS, then test with actual Lambda execution to verify the ffmpeg functionality works in the cloud environment.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE DISCOVERED & FIXED: Layer Directory Structure

**Problem Found:**
During Lambda testing, encountered error: `spawn /opt/bin/ffmpeg ENOENT`

**Root Cause:**
The initial ffmpeg layer had incorrect directory structure:
```
ffmpeg-layer/          ‚ùå Wrong - creates /opt/ffmpeg-layer/bin/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ffmpeg
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ffprobe
```

**Solution Applied:**
Fixed the zip structure to be:
```
bin/                   ‚úÖ Correct - creates /opt/bin/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ffmpeg
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ffprobe
```

**Changes Made:**
1. ‚úÖ Updated `1-prepare-ffmpeg-layer.sh` - Fixed zip command to use correct structure
2. ‚úÖ Regenerated `ffmpeg-layer.zip` with proper directory layout
3. ‚úÖ Verified structure: Layer now contains `bin/ffmpeg` and `bin/ffprobe` at root level

**Action Required:**
Run `terraform apply` to deploy the corrected ffmpeg layer, then retest Lambda execution.

# Implementation Plan: Improve Transcribe Via Whisper

## Overview
Enhance the transcription system with robust retry logic and multiple API provider options to handle timeouts/connection issues and provide fallback alternatives.

## Progress Status

### ✅ 1. Retry Logic Implementation - COMPLETED
- ✅ Add configurable retry constants (MAX_RETRIES = 3, TIMEOUT_MS = 60000) 
- ✅ Create generic retry wrapper function with exponential backoff
- ✅ Apply to all API providers (OpenAI, Replicate, Deepgram) 
- ✅ Handle specific error types: timeout, ECONNRESET, rate limiting

### ✅ 2. API Provider Implementations - COMPLETED

#### ✅ OpenAI (existing - enhance with retries) - COMPLETED
- ✅ Add retry logic to existing implementation
- ✅ Handle timeout and connection reset errors specifically

#### ✅ Replicate - COMPLETED
- ✅ Implement prediction-based API workflow
- ✅ Submit transcription job via POST to /v1/predictions
- ✅ Poll for completion with configurable intervals  
- ✅ Handle async prediction lifecycle (starting -> processing -> succeeded/failed)
- ✅ Use model version from docs: whisper latest

#### ✅ Deepgram - COMPLETED  
- ✅ Implement straightforward HTTP POST API similar to OpenAI
- ✅ Use whisper model with configurable size (medium default)
- ✅ Support same response formats (srt, json)
- ✅ Handle file streaming upload
- ✅ Convert Deepgram response to SRT format with proper timing

### ✅ 3. Configuration & Environment - COMPLETED
- ✅ Add API keys and config to temp-env-constants.ts:
  - ✅ REPLICATE_API_KEY
  - ✅ DEEPGRAM_API_KEY  
  - ✅ RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS (set to 3)
  - ✅ RETRY_TIMEOUT_MS (set to 60000)
  - ✅ RETRY_BASE_DELAY_MS (set to 1000)
  - ✅ REPLICATE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS (set to 2000)

### 🔄 4. Testing Strategy - MOSTLY COMPLETED (some issues remain)
- ✅ Converted from Jest to Vitest
- ✅ Created vitest.config.ts
- ✅ Mock HTTP requests for all providers
- ✅ Test response format consistency across providers  
- ✅ Integration tests for each provider
- ❌ **ISSUE: Retry logic tests failing** - Mocks not properly triggering retry behavior
- ❌ **ISSUE: Some SRT formatting test expectations** - Need adjustment for segment behavior
- ❌ **ISSUE: OpenAI mocking in test environment** - vi.importMock timing issues

### ✅ 5. Error Handling - COMPLETED
- ✅ Standardize error messages across providers
- ✅ Differentiate between retryable and non-retryable errors
- ✅ Add proper logging for debugging

### ✅ 6. File Structure - COMPLETED
- ✅ Keep main transcribeViaWhisper function as single entry point
- ✅ Separate provider implementations into clear functions
- ✅ Add shared utilities for retry logic and error handling

## Current Issues to Resolve

### Test Issues (Priority: Medium)
1. **Retry Logic Testing**: Tests expect retry behavior but mocks are not properly set up to trigger the retry logic in the test environment
2. **SRT Formatting Expectations**: Tests expect full text strings but SRT conversion correctly breaks into segments - need to adjust test expectations
3. **OpenAI Mock Setup**: Vitest mocking of OpenAI module needs refinement for proper function call counting

### Suggested Next Steps
1. Fix test mocking strategy to properly test retry behavior
2. Adjust SRT formatting test expectations to match actual behavior (segmented output)
3. Verify real-world functionality with `pnpm process-audio-lambda:run:local`
4. Deploy to AWS Lambda for production testing

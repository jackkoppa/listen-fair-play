# Background

We're moving all linting into `/packages/linting`, and we're also writing a *new* linting function,
that will check all file names in S3.

New linting method will go here: 
`packages/linting/lint-s3-files-metadata.ts`

Relevant files to examine:

* `packages/linting/package.json`
* `package.json`
* Directory structure only of `aws-local-dev/s3`

General notes:
* Use `pnpm`
* Will need to add spec(s)
* `pnpm all:build` if we need to build all `packages/`
* important that the linting scripts we add can be run against `:local` (i.e. files saved in `aws-local-dev/s3`) OR AWS S3 (see other scripts that run with `:dev-s3` in package.json)


### Answers to initial questions

RSS Feed Source: Should I parse RSS feeds directly from the URLs in RSS_CONFIG, or use the already-parsed episode manifest as the source of truth? The manifest seems like the better source since it's already normalized.
    A: Use the downloaded RSS feed, from the URLs in RSS_CONFIG. Because you'll need to compare the computed fileKeys from that feed, with what's currently in `full-episode-manifest.json` - that needs to be linted as well.
File Key Matching: When checking if files match getEpisodeFileKey() output, should I:
    Strip the file extension before comparing? (e.g., compare 2020-01-23_The-Transfer-Window vs 2020-01-23_The-Transfer-Window.mp3)
        A: For each file type, compare the full file name to what's expected, i.e. is it `2020-01-23_The-Transfer-Window.mp3` as expected
    Handle cases where files might have slightly different naming patterns?
        A: Nope - all files should be of the format `fileKey.extension` - they should all have the same `fileKey`
Orphaned File Detection: For files that don't match any expected episode, what's the criteria for marking them as "should be removed"? Should I:
    Flag any file that doesn't correspond to a manifest episode?
        A: Yup, flag every file that doesn't match that
    Have exceptions for certain file types (like .DS_Store, directory markers, etc.)?
        A: No exceptions
Fix Application: When applyFixes = true, what types of fixes should be applied automatically?
    Unicode normalization fixes (rename files to NFC)?
        A: If the matching file exists, but just hasn't had `.normalize('NFC')` applied, then just update the name of the file to what it should be (i.e. with `normalize` applied)
    Remove confirmed orphaned files?
        A: Yup, remove orphaned files
    Update the episode manifest?
        A: Yup, update the episode manifest if any of the entries are wrong
    A: IMPORTANT: When running from the CLI with `applyFixes = true`, we should first output all the updates that would be applied, and then give the user the option to opt in or out of actually running those fixes (e.g. "these files will be deleted, these will be renamed, do you want to apply that?")
Environment Scope: Should this linter work against both :local (files in aws-local-dev/s3) and :dev-s3/:prod-s3 environments, similar to other scripts? I see the requirement mentions both.
    A: Yup, should be able to run against both types of environments

# Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a comprehensive S3 file metadata linter that validates all podcast files against RSS feeds and ensures proper file naming, structure, and completeness.

## Core Logic Flow

### 1. Data Collection Phase
- **Parse RSS Feeds**: Download and parse RSS feeds from `RSS_CONFIG` URLs (not from manifest)
- **Load Episode Manifest**: Read `episode-manifest/full-episode-manifest.json`
- **Scan S3 Files**: List all files in `audio/`, `transcripts/`, `search-entries/` directories

### 2. Validation Phase
For each episode in RSS feeds:
- **Generate Expected File Key**: Use `getEpisodeFileKey(episodeTitle, pubDateStr)`
- **Check Required Files Exist**:
  - `audio/{podcastId}/{fileKey}.mp3`
  - `transcripts/{podcastId}/{fileKey}.srt` 
  - `search-entries/{podcastId}/{fileKey}.json`
- **Validate Manifest Entry**: Ensure episode exists in manifest with correct fileKey
- **Check Unicode Normalization**: Verify all file names are valid UTF-8 (NFC)

### 3. Issue Detection
- **Missing Files**: RSS episodes without corresponding S3 files
- **Incorrect File Names**: Files that don't match expected `getEpisodeFileKey()` output
- **Unicode Issues**: Files that match when normalized but aren't properly normalized
- **Orphaned Files**: S3 files that don't correspond to any RSS episode
- **Manifest Issues**: Entries in manifest that don't match RSS feed data

### 4. Fix Application (when `applyFixes = true`)
- **Preview Changes**: Show all proposed fixes to user
- **User Confirmation**: Require explicit approval before applying changes
- **Apply Fixes**:
  - Rename files for Unicode normalization
  - Remove orphaned files
  - Update episode manifest with correct data

## Interface Design

```typescript
interface LintResult {
  issues: LintIssue[];
  summary: LintSummary;
  hasErrors: boolean;
}

interface LintIssue {
  type: 'missing-file' | 'incorrect-filename' | 'unicode-issue' | 'orphaned-file' | 'manifest-mismatch';
  severity: 'error' | 'warning';
  description: string;
  episodeInfo?: {
    podcastId: string;
    title: string;
    fileKey: string;
  };
  filePath?: string;
  expectedPath?: string;
  fixAction?: 'rename' | 'delete' | 'create' | 'update-manifest';
}
```

## Environment Support
- Support both `:local` (aws-local-dev/s3) and `:dev-s3`/`:prod-s3` environments
- Use existing S3 utilities from `@listen-fair-play/s3` package
- Respect `FILE_STORAGE_ENV` environment variable

## CLI Integration
- Add script to `packages/linting/package.json`: `"lint:s3-files-metadata": "tsx ./lint-s3-files-metadata.ts"`
- Add script to root `package.json` with environment options:
  - `"lint:s3-metadata:local": "FILE_STORAGE_ENV=local pnpm --filter @listen-fair-play/linting lint:s3-files-metadata"`
  - `"lint:s3-metadata:dev-s3": "FILE_STORAGE_ENV=dev-s3 pnpm --filter @listen-fair-play/linting lint:s3-files-metadata"`

## Implementation Steps
1. ‚úÖ Write implementation plan
2. ‚úÖ Implement core linting logic - **COMPLETE** (677 lines, fully functional)
3. ‚úÖ Add RSS feed parsing integration - **COMPLETE** (xml2js integration working)
4. ‚úÖ Add file validation and issue detection - **COMPLETE** (comprehensive validation)
5. ‚úÖ Implement fix application with user confirmation - **COMPLETE** (preview + confirmation flow)
6. ‚úÖ Add CLI entry point and error handling - **COMPLETE** (--apply-fixes flag support)
7. üîÑ Write comprehensive tests - **TODO**
8. ‚úÖ Update package.json scripts - **COMPLETE** (working scripts added)

## Implementation Notes & Context

### Key Files Created/Modified
- `packages/linting/lint-s3-files-metadata.ts` - Main implementation (677 lines)
- `packages/linting/utils/get-episode-file-key.ts` - Utility for file key generation
- `packages/linting/utils/parse-pub-date.ts` - Date parsing utility
- `packages/linting/package.json` - Added xml2js dependencies and scripts
- `packages/linting/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `package.json` - Root scripts for local/dev-s3 environments

### Successful Test Results
**Last run from `packages/linting/` directory:**
- ‚úÖ Found and parsed 439 episodes across all RSS feeds
- ‚úÖ Successfully loaded episode manifest from local S3
- ‚úÖ Scanned S3 directories (found 0 files as expected in empty local environment)
- ‚úÖ Identified 1,756 missing files (439 episodes √ó 4 file types each)
- ‚úÖ Generated comprehensive issue report with exact file paths
- ‚úÖ Proper error codes and exit handling

### Important Technical Notes

**S3 Package Path Resolution:**
- Script must be run from `packages/linting/` directory due to S3 package's relative path calculation
- Local path resolution: `process.cwd() + '../../../aws-local-dev/s3'`
- When run from root: resolves incorrectly to `/Users/aws-local-dev/s3`
- When run from `packages/linting/`: resolves correctly to project's `aws-local-dev/s3`

**Working Commands:**
```bash
# From packages/linting directory:
FILE_STORAGE_ENV=local pnpm exec tsx lint-s3-files-metadata.ts

# Using package script (from packages/linting):
pnpm lint:s3-files-metadata:local

# From root (currently fails due to path resolution):
pnpm lint:s3-metadata:local  # ‚ùå Path resolution issue
```

**Dependencies:**
- Added `xml2js` and `@types/xml2js` for RSS parsing
- Workspace dependencies: `@listen-fair-play/s3`, `@listen-fair-play/logging`, `@listen-fair-play/rss`
- Required user to fix workspace configuration for dependencies to work

**Implementation Features:**
- RSS feed fetching and parsing from RSS_CONFIG URLs
- Episode manifest validation and comparison
- File existence checking with Unicode normalization support
- Comprehensive issue categorization (missing files, unicode issues, orphaned files, manifest mismatches)
- Fix preview with user confirmation prompts
- Support for both `:local` and `:dev-s3`/`:prod-s3` environments
- Detailed logging and progress reporting
- Proper exit codes for CI/CD integration

### Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ **Fix path resolution** - **COMPLETE** - Script now works from root directory  
2. ‚úÖ **Write tests** - **COMPLETE** - Comprehensive test suite with 24 passing tests
3. ‚úÖ **Test with real data** - **COMPLETE** - Successfully validated against 1,311 real files
4. ‚úÖ **Test fix application** - **COMPLETE** - Fix preview and application system working correctly
5. ‚úÖ **Documentation** - **COMPLETE** - Comprehensive usage guide and troubleshooting

### Recent Updates

#### ‚úÖ Path Resolution Fix (COMPLETE)
**Issue**: Script only worked when run from `packages/linting/` directory due to `process.cwd()` in S3 package.

**Solution**: Modified `packages/s3/index.ts` line 16 to use file-relative path instead of current working directory:
```typescript
// Before (broken):
const LOCAL_S3_PATH = path.join(process.cwd(), '../../../aws-local-dev/s3');

// After (fixed):
const LOCAL_S3_PATH = path.join(path.dirname(new URL(import.meta.url).pathname), '../../../aws-local-dev/s3');
```

**Verification**: Both commands now work correctly:
- `pnpm lint:s3-metadata:local` (from root) ‚úÖ 
- `pnpm lint:s3-files-metadata:local` (from packages/linting) ‚úÖ

#### ‚úÖ Comprehensive Test Suite (COMPLETE)
**Implementation**: Added 24 comprehensive tests covering all core functionality:

**Test Coverage:**
- ‚úÖ **parsePubDate** (3 tests) - RFC2822, ISO dates, invalid dates
- ‚úÖ **getEpisodeFileKey** (9 tests) - Character replacement, Unicode normalization, truncation, edge cases  
- ‚úÖ **RSS Parsing** (3 tests) - XML structure validation, episode extraction, field validation

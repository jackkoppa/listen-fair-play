This repo originally could _only_ work for searching the archives of the [Football ClichÃ©s podcast](https://podfollow.com/new-football-cliches). 

What a podcast that is, by the way.

[listenfairplay.com](https://listenfairplay.com) will always be the home of that search.

Now, you're also able to search _any_ podcast - find out more at [browse.show](https://browse.show)

22
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:34,560
I'm sorry, you can sit there and look and play with all your silly machines as much as you like.

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,920
Is Gascoigne going to have a crack? He is, you know.

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,280
Oh, he's there!

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,280
Brilliant!

26
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,800
The change!

27
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,280
He's ran the goalkeeper, he's done it!

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,440
Absolutely incredible!

29
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:58,160
He launched himself six feet into the crowd, and Kung Fu kicked a supporter who was eye-whip

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,400
without a shadow of a doubt giving him lip.

31
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,360
Oh, I say! It's amazing!

32
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,400
He does it time, and time, and time again.

33
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,760
Crank up the music! Charge a glass!

34
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,920
This nation is going to dance all night!

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,920
A lovely brace of shot urging from the travelling Watford faithful.

36
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,360
Troy Deeney's cruel dig at a Sunday evening TV stalwart.

37
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,000
Seamus Coleman produces the most loyal 3.67 seconds in football history.

38
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:38,560
This is the second part, you can sit there and look and play with all your silly machines as much as you like.

39
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,920
Is Second Gascoigne going to have a crack? He is, you know.

40
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,280
Oh, he's definitely there!

41
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,280
Super Brilliant!

42
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,800
Another change!

43
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,280
He's ran the goalkeeper again, he's done it again!

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,440
Absolutely very incredible!

45
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:02,160
He launched himself twelve feet into the crowd, and Kung Fu kicked another supporter who was eye-whip

46
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,400
without any shadow of a doubt giving him more lip.

47
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,360
Oh, I say again! It's very amazing!

48
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,400
He does it time, and time, and time and time again.

49
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,760
Crank up more music! Charge another glass!

50
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,920
This entire nation is going to dance all night long!

51
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,920
A second lovely brace of shot urging from the travelling Watford faithful.

52
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,360
Another Troy Deeney's cruel dig at a Monday evening TV stalwart.

53
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,000
Another Seamus Coleman produces the most loyal 7.34 seconds in football history.

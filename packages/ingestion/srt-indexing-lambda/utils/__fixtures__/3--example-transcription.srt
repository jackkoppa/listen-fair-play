946
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:41,500
I mean, it's just an incredible, like, that is the question we've been up, what is this about?

947
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:45,200
It's just an extraordinary, I mean, stream of consciousness.

948
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,120
Though he's obviously thought about it quite a lot.

949
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:51,720
I think it's a PB for Keezy, Dave, to have two people just staring at it in blankly going,

950
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,020
what are you talking about?

951
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:54,580
Not that it was completely outlandish.

952
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,360
I mean, he, you know, he backed it all up.

953
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,420
It was a good, I mean, it wasn't a completely outlandish name.

954
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,060
It wasn't Roberto Martinez or anything like that.

955
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,240
that but i think my name wasn't the kind of structure that to go with it was but it was

956
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:10,420
quite yeah it's quite a progressive uh view from for kesey xabi alonso is the sort of name you'd

957
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:17,100
expect the uh the stats nerds to be to be pushing for these sorts of jobs kesey normally would go

958
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:22,520
go with what he knows the five years thing you're telling me that if if xabi alonso gets this job

959
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:27,160
got this job somehow in the summer or whatever and it was all going to shit come next december you

960
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:31,360
wouldn't be you wouldn't be saying it wouldn't be in his blog yeah he wouldn't be saying don't

961
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:37,160
worry jabi jabi a loser get him out of that club before we tear apart some of these details you

962
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:41,380
have to remember the context in which it's being delivered i think at first gray sort of gives him

963
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:45,120
carte blanche and says right you're in charge of man united what would you do and then kesey ignores

964
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:49,020
that and basically starts talking like a management consultant who's been drafted in to tell man united

965
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:54,140
what to do exactly like i think he would actually say if he was i think my favorite bit dave is where

966
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:58,340
he's assessing alonso's impact oliverkusen says that everything he's done has what hasn't turned

967
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:05,600
to gold but that's amazing that's so good that's the sprinkling of partridge that you need i think

968
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:10,140
yeah it's just that just the checking of himself and styling it out i just think it's just utterly

969
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:16,560
superb yeah and then on top of that the the slight irritation when anyone challenges him on anything

970
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:21,040
like mackett's saying he wouldn't he wouldn't go there why not why wouldn't he go there because

971
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,660
one minute he's saying the top players just not gonna go they're just not gonna go there yeah and

972
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:31,120
then he says that this guy who's who's been fated as the you know the the as he says the next best

973
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:37,080
young thing not even the next big thing the next best young thing would go there there are two things

974
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:41,540
amazing as well with that uh not quite gold is that gray really earnestly responds to that as well

975
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:47,680
no no no like as if that is like they are really gonna get into what he's turned it to the other

976
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:52,760
thing i'm that i am just really curious about like dave says xavi alonso is a is a weird one for keys to

977
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:58,120
come out with so i'm just really fascinated as to what is it about alonso that is it that he likes

978
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:04,120
alonso's look and that he thinks you know he's you know he he's got something about him well this is it

979
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:08,880
i mean as we all know from sort of the body of his work on being sports from the last year or so the

980
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,580
one thing he values over anything else at the management is someone who's got a big character

981
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:18,160
a big personality yeah and that's what i think he alonso has he has that kind of statesman like

982
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:23,620
kind of sort of stature about him already won everything played for big clubs yeah yeah i suppose

983
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:29,300
so he's got that gravitas at the big moments at big clubs on big nights and i think he's ready for

984
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:35,800
the big job and there we are saudi money where's that coming from by the way hilarious absolutely

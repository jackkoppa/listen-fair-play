22
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:34,560
I'm sorry, you can sit there and look and play with all your silly machines as much as you like.

23
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,920
Is Gascoigne going to have a crack? He is, you know.

24
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,280
Oh, he's there!

25
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,280
Brilliant!

26
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,800
The change!

27
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,280
He's ran the goalkeeper, he's done it!

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,440
Absolutely incredible!

29
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:58,160
He launched himself six feet into the crowd, and Kung Fu kicked a supporter who was eye-whip

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,400
without a shadow of a doubt giving him lip.

31
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,360
Oh, I say! It's amazing!

32
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,400
He does it time, and time, and time again.

33
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,760
Crank up the music! Charge a glass!

34
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,920
This nation is going to dance all night!

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,920
A lovely brace of shot urging from the travelling Watford faithful.

36
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,360
Troy Deeney's cruel dig at a Sunday evening TV stalwart.

37
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,000
Seamus Coleman produces the most loyal 3.67 seconds in football history.

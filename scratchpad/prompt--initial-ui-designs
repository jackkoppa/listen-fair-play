# Requirements

* You will be designing UI mocks for the Football Cliches podcast archive searching application. The application is called "Listen, Fair Play". We'll call the application "LFP" for short, throughout the remainder of these instructions
* LFP is mobile-first
* The primary functionality is searching for key phrases from the past 5+ years of episodes, along with filtering by things like panelists & episode type, as well as sorting by relevance vs. date
* For each result, the user will be able to see their search terms highlighted in the result, and when clicked, see that segment of the transcript in context of the full episode transcript. They will be able to press "play" on an audio player, and it will start from that segment of the podcast (if the user scrubs to a different portion of the podcast, the transcript will scroll down or up to that moment)
* As bonus functionality, users will see a small graphical representation of search results over time (likely a bar chart, with time on the X axis). If the user clicks on that chart, they will be taken to an expanded view, that shows the chart rather than a list of search results. It's possible to toggle between these two views, but the search bar + filters should always stay visible, and the search results page is the default / primary focus. The graphical/chart view is lower priority
* There is currently no settings page or profile for LFP - just GET requests, no user-provided data that we need to save. We can link a small "About" sheet somewhere in the top nav or footer, and it will briefly explain LFP + link to the repo. 
* LFP is mobile-first, but for every UI mock, also provide a tablet/desktop UI.



# Inspiration

* Attached are screenshots of content provided by Footbal Cliches / Adam Hurrey (the primary host)

Does language evolve? Yes, it does.

Will it ever be acceptable for a football commentator to call a shot that bounces before it goes in 'a screamer'? No, it will not.

As the self-appointed world expert on the subject, Adam Hurrey sets off to define the definitive rules of the language of football.

He will answer the big questions such as: is it acceptable to say a player is 'breaking their silence' (it's complicated), can headers can be 'lashed' (anatomically impossible), whether a penalty shootout could ever be described as 'late drama' (truly abhorrent), how many games constitute a 'bumper' day of Premier League action (minimum of eight) and just how big a deficit constitutes 'a mountain to climb' (certainly not Liverpool going 1-0 down at home to Wolves in the third minute, Sky Sports).

Along the way, Hurrey examines some case studies of how the football media has reached saturation point - the transfer rumour mill, the futile art of big-match previewing, the rise of (and backlash against) football jargon - and how its language has evolved to keep the machine going.

Have we let the football lexicon spiral out of control? In finding out, this book will be exactly as gloriously pedantic as it sounds.

* Words that would describe the vibe LFP should have: 
   * restrained
   * witty
   * tongue-in-cheek
   * classy
   * not-taking-itself-too-seriously
   * visually straightforward
   * sufficient whitespace 


* I have already picked the theme we'll be using, for maximum maintainability:
https://tweakcn.com/editor/theme?theme=neo-brutalism
* Screenshots are attached
* This should mostly match the vibe above
* We'll rely on components from Shad CDN: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/sheet
   * the example, "Sheet", linked there, is one such component we'll be using



Next, we'll proceed to start with the first of 4 screens we have planned:
1. Home page - empty search UI
2. Home page - search UI with results
3. Episode sheet - "Sheet" that loads episode transcript, scrollable, and audio player
4. Data visualization - search UI, but instead of listed search results, a chart showing when results occurred

Don't do anything yet, just let me know: are you ready to proceed?
